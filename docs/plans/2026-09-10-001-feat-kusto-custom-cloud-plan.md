# feat: Add custom cloud support for Kusto queries

## Overview

Extend configuration-driven custom-cloud support to Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) data-plane queries. A custom-cloud deployment will declare a trusted Kusto DNS suffix and an explicit OAuth scope; Kusto commands will continue discovering cluster URIs through Azure Resource Graph or accepting `--cluster-uri`, but every resulting URI will be validated before Kusto-scope token acquisition, Kusto client caching, or Kusto data-plane HTTP. Subscription discovery may first perform the management-plane authentication and Resource Graph request required to obtain the URI.

The implementation will preserve the existing direct REST client, `IAzureService` credential and HTTP paths, transport independence, Native AOT compatibility, and built-in Azure public, US Government, and China behavior.

## Problem Frame

Custom-cloud metadata currently configures identity, ARM, Resource Graph, Log Analytics, and Application Insights endpoints, but Kusto queries still rely on hard-coded Azure Kusto DNS suffixes and hostname-derived token scopes. As a result, a cluster URI returned by Resource Graph or supplied directly is rejected when it belongs to a configured custom cloud, and the client has no safe way to select that cloud's Kusto OAuth audience.

Kusto differs from Log Analytics because the query endpoint is cluster-specific rather than one cloud-wide service endpoint. The configuration therefore needs to describe the trusted cluster namespace, not synthesize or replace individual cluster URIs.

## Requirements Trace

- **R1. Custom endpoint trust:** A custom cloud can configure one trusted Kusto DNS suffix that authorizes cluster URIs beneath that suffix.
- **R2. Custom authentication:** Queries to an authorized custom Kusto cluster request exactly the configured Kusto OAuth scope.
- **R3. Both cluster-selection paths:** Subscription/cluster discovery and direct `--cluster-uri` queries converge on the same endpoint validation and scope-selection behavior.
- **R4. Fail closed:** Partial or malformed metadata fails during configuration loading; absent metadata blocks Kusto data-plane invocation; and a cluster hostname outside the configured suffix fails before Kusto-scope token acquisition, cache insertion, or data-plane HTTP.
- **R5. Compatibility:** Existing public, US Government, and China Kusto endpoint and scope behavior remains unchanged.
- **R6. Isolation:** When `CloudType` is `CustomCloud`, the configured suffix replaces the built-in Kusto trust set; built-in endpoints are not implicitly trusted.
- **R7. Optional adoption:** Existing custom-cloud configurations that do not use the Kusto data plane remain valid, and Resource Graph-only cluster inventory remains available.
- **R8. Cross-layer confidence:** Deterministic coverage proves that public Azure endpoints can be declared through the custom-cloud configuration and used through the Kusto service/client query path; existing recordings continue to prove protocol compatibility.
- **R9. Repository completeness:** Configuration reference material, command documentation, e2e prompts, and changelog metadata describe the new support and its security constraints.

## Scope Boundaries

- Query-lane and Kusto control-command-lane traffic already sharing `KustoClient` should receive the same endpoint trust and authentication behavior; no new Kusto command is added.
- Resource Graph-only cluster list/get commands do not require Kusto suffix/scope metadata and remain available under a custom cloud.
- Cluster URI discovery remains based on the complete `properties.uri` value returned by Resource Graph. The implementation will not construct cluster hosts from names, regions, or suffixes.
- The configured value is a complete OAuth scope ending in `/.default`, consistent with `logAnalyticsScope`; the server will not discover or infer an audience from `/v1/rest/auth/metadata`.
- Custom-cloud mode trusts only the configured Kusto suffix. Cross-cloud Kusto queries from a custom-cloud server are not supported in this change.
- Only administrator-controlled server configuration can define the trusted suffix and scope. Callers cannot add trusted hosts through command options.
- Private Link continues using the cluster's normal application-facing hostname and controlled DNS. The plan does not add IP-address allowlisting or DNS-resolution policy.
- The work does not migrate the toolset to `Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Data`, add ingestion support, change KQL validation, or alter query result shapes.
- General-purpose DNS-rebinding hardening for shared `HttpClient` infrastructure is outside this feature. Kusto data-plane requests will use a transport configuration that treats every redirect as terminal so an effective destination cannot bypass endpoint validation.
- Broad Kusto response-body, command-log, and activity-tag sanitization is pre-existing security-hardening work and will be tracked separately. This feature must not introduce new logging of suffixes, scopes, tokens, or raw rejected URI components.
- Initial support assumes the target custom cloud exposes its Kusto data-plane hosts beneath one dedicated descendant DNS namespace and accepts one OAuth audience. Estates requiring multiple suffixes, exact-host exceptions, or endpoint-specific audiences are outside the first release and require an additive configuration design.

## Context & Research

### Relevant Code and Patterns

- `core/Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Services/Azure/Authentication/CustomCloudMetadata.cs` defines configuration-backed custom service metadata.
- `core/Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Services/Azure/Authentication/AzureCloudConfiguration.cs` validates custom metadata, exposes built-in cloud values, and keeps custom authority configuration centralized.
- `core/Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Services/Azure/Authentication/IAzureCloudConfiguration.cs` is the boundary available through `IAzureService.CloudConfiguration`.
- `core/Azure.Mcp.Core/tests/Azure.Mcp.Core.Tests/Services/Azure/Authentication/AzureCloudConfigurationTests.cs` covers custom metadata loading and validation.
- `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/src/Services/KustoService.cs` resolves `Microsoft.Kusto/clusters` through Resource Graph, consumes `properties.uri`, validates KQL, and caches clients.
- `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/src/Services/KustoClient.cs` performs URI validation, selects Kusto token scopes, and sends direct REST requests through `IAzureService`.
- `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto.Tests/KustoClientTests.cs` is the focused endpoint-security test surface.
- `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto.Tests/KustoCommandTests.cs` provides recorded coverage for subscription-based and direct-URI operations.
- `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Monitor/src/Services/MonitorService.cs` and `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Monitor/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Monitor.Tests/Services/MonitorServiceCustomCloudTests.cs` demonstrate explicit custom endpoint/scope usage and deterministic token/request assertions.
- `docs/recorded-tests.md` governs test-proxy recordings and sanitization.

### Institutional Learnings

The repository has no `docs/solutions/` knowledge base for this area. Existing custom-cloud implementation and tests establish the useful conventions:

- Store service endpoints/audiences/scopes explicitly rather than deriving custom-cloud identity metadata from DNS.
- Use the configured authority through the existing credential chain instead of adding a service-specific token endpoint.
- Keep resource discovery and data-plane endpoint trust separate: a URI returned by Resource Graph remains input that must pass Kusto validation.
- Preserve `IAzureService.GetClient()` so recorded tests, proxy behavior, and transport-independent authentication continue to work.

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Add `kustoEndpointSuffix` and `kustoScope` to custom-cloud metadata | Kusto endpoints are cluster-specific, so a trusted namespace plus explicit audience is more appropriate than a single service endpoint. |
| Treat `kustoScope` as the complete `/.default` scope | This matches `logAnalyticsScope`, avoids hidden transformation rules, and makes the exact token audience reviewable in configuration and tests. |
| Keep both fields optional when loading a custom cloud | Existing custom-cloud users who only need ARM, Resource Graph, cluster inventory, or Log Analytics must not be broken. |
| If either Kusto field is supplied, validate the pair at configuration load; if neither is supplied, fail only when Kusto is invoked | This catches malformed partial adoption early while preserving optional adoption. |
| In custom-cloud mode, replace the built-in Kusto suffix allowlist | It prevents accidental cross-cloud token requests and makes the configured trust boundary authoritative. |
| Keep built-in cloud suffix and scope behavior unchanged | This limits blast radius and avoids turning the feature into a broader Kusto authentication refactor. |
| Require a normalized DNS suffix rather than a URI or wildcard | Label-boundary matching is reviewable and prevents substring-based trust bypasses. |
| Continue using the cluster URI returned by Resource Graph | Microsoft exposes the complete endpoint; constructing endpoints would reintroduce cloud-specific assumptions. |
| Do not consume Kusto auth metadata dynamically | An endpoint-provided audience is untrusted network input and could induce token acquisition for another resource. Explicit configuration is safer for a custom cloud. |
| Resolve one canonical endpoint policy before credential lookup and client caching | Trust, scope selection, request construction, and cache identity must not disagree about equivalent or malformed URI representations. |
| Put endpoint classification and scope selection in the shared Kusto service/client path | Direct URI, discovered cluster, query, schema, sample, and management requests then receive one consistent security policy without duplicating validation rules. |
| Disable automatic redirects for Kusto data-plane requests | Validating only the initial URI is insufficient for a token-bearing SSRF boundary; every effective destination must be trusted. |
| Keep cached clients free of request-scoped credentials | Remote HTTP/OBO requests from different users can share tenant and endpoint values; cached state must not retain or replay another request's credential or token. |

### Configuration Contract

- `kustoEndpointSuffix` is normalized by the configuration layer to lower-case ASCII with a leading dot, for example `.kusto.contoso.example`. A safely normalizable missing leading dot or case difference is accepted; structurally ambiguous forms are rejected.
- It cannot include a scheme, wildcard, port, path, query, fragment, user information, whitespace, trailing dot, IP literal, unresolved Unicode host form, encoded delimiter, or single-label top-level value.
- A cluster hostname must contain at least one DNS label before the suffix; the suffix root alone is not a valid cluster endpoint.
- Matching occurs on DNS-label boundaries after URI host canonicalization.
- A cluster URI may have no path or the root path `/`; both normalize to the same origin. Non-root paths are rejected.
- Explicit ports, including `:443`, are rejected for cluster URIs and scopes so cache, audience, and request identity have one representation.
- `kustoScope` is one canonical absolute HTTPS scope URI ending in `/.default`, with no explicit port, user information, query, fragment, dot segment, encoded path delimiter, unresolved Unicode host form, or whitespace. It is passed unchanged as the sole token scope.
- A custom-cloud configuration containing only one of the two properties is invalid.
- Both properties omitted or explicitly `null` mean Kusto was not configured. Empty or whitespace values are malformed attempted configuration.
- A custom-cloud configuration containing neither property remains valid, but a Kusto operation produces an actionable missing-configuration error before discovery, cache access, or credential acquisition.
- The suffix and scope form one administrator-approved credential-delivery grant: any accepted descendant host can receive a token for exactly that configured audience. The operator is responsible for their semantic correspondence; the server does not infer, repair, or fall back to another audience.

## Open Questions

### Resolved During Planning

- **Trust model:** Use one configured DNS suffix plus one explicit OAuth scope.
- **Built-in endpoints under custom mode:** The custom suffix replaces built-in Kusto trust.
- **Scope representation:** Store the complete `/.default` scope.
- **Audience discovery:** Do not query `/v1/rest/auth/metadata`.
- **Adoption compatibility:** Kusto metadata is optional for the overall custom cloud but required for Kusto operations.
- **Public-cloud validation:** Add a deterministic cross-layer scenario that declares public endpoints and `.kusto.windows.net` through the custom-cloud configuration.
- **Inventory behavior:** Cluster list/get remain management-plane-only and available without Kusto suffix/scope metadata.
- **Initial topology:** The first release supports one dedicated descendant suffix and one audience; broader endpoint-grant collections are deferred until a concrete target requires them.

### Deferred to Implementation

- **Exact exception type and message composition:** Reuse the nearest repository-standard configuration/trust exception once the existing command error mapping is inspected; new validation messages must name the missing property or rejected canonical hostname without exposing suffix/scope values or raw URI components.
- **Recorded-test compatibility:** Preserve the existing Kusto recordings because the REST request and response shapes are unchanged; avoid adding a recording that cannot be reproduced without live test resources.
- **Follow-up hardening:** Review existing Kusto response-body reflection and command logging in a separate security-focused change rather than expanding this feature.

## High-Level Technical Design

> *This illustrates the intended approach and is directional guidance for review, not implementation specification. The implementing agent should treat it as context, not code to reproduce.*

    participant Config as Custom cloud JSON
    participant Cloud as AzureCloudConfiguration
    participant Command as Kusto command
    participant Service as KustoService
    participant Policy as Kusto endpoint policy

    participant Kusto as Kusto REST endpoint

    Config->>Cloud: Load authority, ARM, Kusto suffix, Kusto scope
    Command->>Service: Query by cluster name or direct URI
    Service->>Policy: Preflight custom Kusto metadata availability
    Service->>Service: Resolve properties.uri when needed
    Service->>Policy: Canonicalize URI, validate trust, select scope
    Policy->>Cloud: Read cloud type and immutable Kusto metadata
    Service->>Service: Lookup cache by canonical origin and operation lane
    Service->>Client: Create/reuse client with resolved policy
    Client->>Identity: Request token for selected scope
    Client->>Kusto: Send existing REST request
```

The data-plane client decision matrix is:

| Active cloud | Accepted Kusto hosts | Scope source |
|---|---|---|
| Any built-in cloud | Existing combined built-in host trust set | Existing host-derived scope mapping |
| Custom with complete Kusto metadata | Only hosts beneath `kustoEndpointSuffix` | Configured `kustoScope` |
| Custom without complete Kusto metadata | None | Reject before token acquisition |

Under `CustomCloud`, membership in the static built-in allowlist grants no trust. A hostname that resembles a built-in endpoint is accepted only if it independently matches the configured custom suffix, and it always receives the configured custom scope.

Resource Graph-only cluster list/get operations do not enter this matrix because they do not contact the Kusto data plane.

## Implementation Units

- [x] **Unit 1: Extend and validate custom-cloud Kusto metadata**

**Goal:** Add an AOT-safe configuration contract for the trusted Kusto suffix and OAuth scope without breaking custom clouds that do not use Kusto.

**Requirements:** R1, R2, R4, R7

**Dependencies:** None

**Files:**
- Modify: `core/Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Services/Azure/Authentication/CustomCloudMetadata.cs`
- Modify: `core/Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Services/Azure/Authentication/IAzureCloudConfiguration.cs`
- Modify: `core/Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Services/Azure/Authentication/AzureCloudConfiguration.cs`
- Verify/modify if required: `core/Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Services/Azure/Authentication/CustomCloudMetadataJsonContext.cs`
- Test: `core/Azure.Mcp.Core/tests/Azure.Mcp.Core.Tests/Services/Azure/Authentication/AzureCloudConfigurationTests.cs`

**Approach:**
- Add nullable Kusto suffix and scope metadata exposed through `IAzureCloudConfiguration`.
- Keep both absent values valid for custom clouds that do not invoke Kusto.
- Validate supplied values as a complete pair and enforce the configuration contract above.
- Normalize the suffix once in the configuration layer so consumers do not implement competing normalization rules.
- Preserve source-generated JSON metadata and avoid reflection-based binding or validation.
- Keep built-in cloud behavior stable; Kusto-specific built-in mappings remain owned by the Kusto client unless implementation reveals a clean no-risk centralization.

**Execution note:** Add configuration characterization tests before changing validation behavior.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing Log Analytics metadata and validation in `AzureCloudConfiguration`.
- Existing custom-cloud tests in `AzureCloudConfigurationTests`.

**Test scenarios:**
- **Happy path:** Load a custom JSON file containing valid Kusto suffix and complete scope; expose normalized values through `IAzureCloudConfiguration`.
- **Compatibility:** Load an existing custom JSON file with neither Kusto property; custom-cloud construction succeeds and other metadata is unchanged.
- **Error path:** Supply only `kustoEndpointSuffix`; configuration fails and identifies `kustoScope`.
- **Error path:** Supply only `kustoScope`; configuration fails and identifies `kustoEndpointSuffix`.
- **Edge cases:** Reject suffix values containing a scheme, wildcard, path, port, whitespace, trailing dot, IP literal, or an overly broad/single-label suffix.
- **Edge cases:** Normalize permitted case and a missing leading dot into the documented lower-case, leading-dot representation; reject forms that cannot be normalized without ambiguity.
- **Error path:** Reject scopes that are non-HTTPS, omit `/.default`, or contain user information, query, fragment, or whitespace.
- **Regression:** Built-in cloud configuration remains constructible and its existing authority/ARM/Log Analytics values remain unchanged.

**Verification:**
- Valid custom Kusto metadata is available through the existing cloud-configuration boundary.
- Invalid partial or malformed metadata fails deterministically without network access.
- Custom clouds without Kusto metadata continue to support unrelated services.

- [x] **Unit 2: Apply custom endpoint trust and scope selection in `KustoClient`**

**Goal:** Route all Kusto data-plane requests through cloud-aware endpoint classification that safely supports the configured custom suffix.

**Requirements:** R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6

**Dependencies:** Unit 1

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/src/Services/KustoClient.cs`
- Modify: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/src/Services/KustoService.cs`
- Modify: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/src/KustoSetup.cs`
- Modify: `core/Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Services/Http/HttpClientFactoryConfigurator.cs`
- Test: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto.Tests/KustoClientTests.cs`
- Create: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto.Tests/KustoServiceTests.cs`
- Create: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto.Tests/KustoHttpClientRegistrationTests.cs`

**Approach:**
- Resolve one Kusto-owned endpoint decision containing the canonical HTTPS origin and selected scope. Keep one enforceable construction boundary: either the client remains the sole resolver and exposes a pre-cache resolution operation, or it requires an immutable resolved value and raw URI construction is constrained. Do not preserve parallel raw and resolved paths.
- For direct `--cluster-uri`, complete policy resolution before tenant resolution, credential lookup, cache access, or HTTP.
- For subscription-based data-plane operations, preflight custom Kusto metadata availability before management-plane work; then permit Resource Graph discovery and resolve the returned URI before any Kusto-scope token request, Kusto client cache insertion, or data-plane HTTP.
- For built-in clouds, retain the current trusted suffixes, exact hosts, and scope mappings.
- For `CustomCloud`, require complete Kusto metadata and accept only canonical HTTPS cluster origins whose hosts have at least one label before the configured suffix.
- Select the configured scope only after the endpoint has matched the configured custom suffix.
- Ignore static built-in trust while custom mode is active. A public-shaped host is accepted only when it matches the configured custom suffix, and then uses the configured custom scope.
- Ensure direct `--cluster-uri` and Resource Graph `properties.uri` values converge on this same validation.
- Use the canonical origin for suffix matching, request construction, and both existing query/control-command cache lanes. Retain lane separation and tenant identity; equivalent accepted URI spellings must not create policy-divergent clients.
- Register an additive named Kusto HTTP client whose primary handler disables automatic redirects while retaining shared proxy, recording-handler, timeout, user-agent, and network configuration. The unnamed/default client and unrelated tools keep their existing redirect behavior.
- Have the Kusto path request the named client through the existing `IAzureService`/`IHttpClientFactory` boundary; do not construct a standalone `HttpClient` or bypass test-proxy behavior.
- Treat all Kusto 3xx responses as terminal and ensure no second request follows a `Location` value.
- Preserve existing Kusto REST error behavior in this feature except that new validation paths must not add sensitive configuration or raw URI values to errors or logs.
- Preserve REST paths, headers, payloads, result parsing, timeouts, and tenant-aware credential acquisition.
- Rely on process-immutable singleton cloud configuration to keep policy stable. Cache keys must use canonical origin, tenant, and the existing operation lane; include additional policy identity only if implementation reveals a mutable boundary.
- Cached objects must not retain request-scoped `TokenCredential` instances or bearer tokens. Resolve request identity within the current invocation so two OBO users in the same tenant cannot share authentication state.

**Execution note:** Implement endpoint classification and scope-selection behavior test-first because it is a token-bearing SSRF boundary.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing `ValidateAndNormalizeClusterUri` and `GetKustoScope` behavior in `KustoClient`.
- Exact scope/request assertions in `MonitorServiceCustomCloudTests`.
- Existing trusted suffix boundary tests in `KustoClientTests`.

**Test scenarios:**
- **Happy path:** Under `CustomCloud`, a direct URI beneath the configured suffix is normalized, requests exactly the configured scope, and sends the existing query request to the expected REST URI.
- **Scope proof:** Configure `.kusto.windows.net` with a distinct valid custom HTTPS scope and assert that exact scope—not the existing public hostname-derived scope—is requested.
- **Happy path:** A URI discovered through the service path beneath the configured suffix receives identical validation and scope behavior.
- **Error path:** Under `CustomCloud` with no Kusto metadata, reject before discovery, credential-provider access, cache access, token requests, or HTTP.
- **Error path:** Reject a direct custom hostname outside the configured suffix before tenant resolution, credential access, cache access, or HTTP.
- **Discovery error path:** Null, empty, non-deserializable, or parseable off-suffix `properties.uri` values may require different exception paths but all produce zero Kusto-scope token requests, cache insertions, and data-plane requests.
- **Security edge case:** Reject substring lookalikes, the suffix root itself, userinfo, non-HTTPS schemes, IP literals, explicit/unexpected ports, paths, queries, fragments, trailing-dot hosts, backslashes, encoded authority/path delimiters, and unresolved Unicode host forms.
- **Security edge case:** Under custom mode, a built-in Kusto host outside the configured suffix is rejected; one matching the configured suffix receives only the configured custom scope.
- **Canonicalization:** Equivalent permitted case/trailing-slash representations reuse the same lane-specific cached client; rejected alternate representations never reach the cache.
- **Redirects:** For 301, 302, 303, 307, and 308 responses with same-origin, same-suffix, external, loopback, or link-local `Location` values, assert one outbound request and no request/body/header delivery to the redirect target.
- **Transport registration:** Resolve the named Kusto client through production DI with and without the recording-proxy resolver; it does not follow redirects, while the unnamed/default client remains behaviorally unchanged.
- **Service ordering:** Mock cache, credential, Resource Graph, and HTTP dependencies to prove direct invalid inputs cause zero cache/credential/network calls and discovered invalid inputs cause no Kusto cache/credential/data-plane calls after discovery.
- **OBO isolation:** Two same-tenant requests with distinct request-scoped credentials cannot reuse the first request's credential or token through either cache lane.
- **Inventory compatibility:** Cluster list/get continue to use Resource Graph successfully when custom Kusto data-plane metadata is absent.
- **Regression:** Under each built-in cloud, retain its accepted hosts and exact existing token scope.
- **Regression:** Presence of custom metadata does not activate custom behavior when the active cloud is built-in.
- **Failure path:** Token acquisition failures and Kusto REST failures continue through existing exception handling without logging or returning credentials.
- **Integration:** Query, database, schema, table, sample, and Kusto control-command operations that contact the data plane inherit the same trust policy without command-specific branching.

**Verification:**
- No custom Kusto request can acquire a token or send HTTP unless the cluster host matches the configured suffix.
- Every accepted custom request uses the configured scope.
- Direct inputs are validated before credential/cache work; discovered inputs are validated before any Kusto data-plane credential/cache work.
- Redirects cannot create an unvalidated effective destination, and unrelated clients retain their existing transport behavior.
- Existing built-in Kusto tests and behavior remain stable.

- [x] **Unit 3: Add cross-layer custom-cloud query coverage**

**Goal:** Prove configuration-to-service behavior where public Azure endpoints are deliberately supplied through the custom-cloud contract.

**Requirements:** R3, R4, R5, R7, R8

**Dependencies:** Units 1 and 2

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto.Tests/KustoCustomCloudIntegrationTests.cs`
- Preserve: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto.Tests/KustoCommandTests.cs`
- Preserve: `tools/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto/tests/Azure.Mcp.Tools.Kusto.Tests/assets.json`

**Approach:**
- Add a cross-layer scenario that loads actual custom-cloud JSON rather than substituting `IAzureCloudConfiguration`.
- Configure public identity/ARM endpoints, `.kusto.windows.net`, and the public Kusto scope while the active cloud is `custom`.
- Exercise the real configuration parser, Kusto service/client path, request-time credential acquisition, named HTTP client selection, request construction, and result parsing with deterministic HTTP and credential test doubles.
- Keep existing recorded tests unchanged because REST paths, payload shapes, and response parsing are unchanged.
- Treat the public-as-custom test as configuration-path wiring evidence; the Unit 2 distinct-scope test proves that hostname fallback is not selecting the scope.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Public-endpoints-as-custom configuration coverage in the Core custom-cloud tests.
- Existing Kusto REST response fixtures and result assertions.

**Test scenarios:**
- **Integration happy path:** Active cloud `custom` plus public endpoints, `.kusto.windows.net`, and public Kusto scope executes the service query path and returns the expected rows.
- **Integration error path:** Custom configuration lacking Kusto metadata produces the expected command error before a Kusto request appears in the recording.
- **Integration security path:** A direct URI outside the configured suffix is rejected without a data-plane request.
- **Recorded-test compatibility:** The existing Kusto playback suite remains green without recording changes.

**Verification:**
- The real custom-cloud configuration parser feeds a successful Kusto service query.
- Direct URI behavior is covered deterministically at the service/client boundary; existing command recordings continue proving protocol compatibility.

- [x] **Unit 4: Document and release the custom-cloud Kusto contract**

**Goal:** Make the new configuration discoverable, reviewable, and complete for repository release requirements.

**Requirements:** R9

**Dependencies:** Units 1-3

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/sovereign-clouds.md`
- Modify: `servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/README.md`
- Modify: `servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/docs/azmcp-commands.md`
- Modify: `servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/docs/e2eTestPrompts.md`
- Create: `servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/changelog-entries/clarked-kusto-custom-cloud.yml`

**Approach:**
- Add the two JSON properties to the custom-cloud schema and example.
- Explain that both are optional globally but jointly required for Kusto operations under `--cloud custom`.
- Document canonical suffix and scope formats, replacement of built-in trust in custom mode, Resource Graph discovery behavior, direct URI behavior, and actionable failure cases.
- Include an example using nonproduction placeholder domains and a separate test note showing how public endpoints can validate the custom path.
- Keep command names and options unchanged; update Kusto command guidance to state that custom-cloud queries use the configured trust boundary.
- Ensure the changelog entry follows `docs/changelog-entries.md` with a non-empty `changes` array and valid section.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing custom ARM/Resource Graph/Log Analytics configuration examples.
- Existing Kusto e2e prompts and command reference entries.
- `servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/changelog-entries/clarked-custom-cloud.yml`.

**Test scenarios:**
- **Test expectation: none —** documentation and changelog metadata carry no executable behavior; schema/spelling validation applies through repository checks.

**Verification:**
- An operator can configure custom-cloud Kusto support without inferring suffix or scope syntax.
- PR completeness surfaces reflect the modified Kusto tool.

## System-Wide Impact

- **Interaction graph:** Server startup options load custom JSON into `AzureCloudConfiguration`; `IAzureService` exposes it to `KustoService`/`KustoClient`; commands reach the same client through direct URI or Resource Graph discovery.
- **Error propagation:** Structural metadata errors fail during configuration loading when partial/malformed values are supplied. Completely absent Kusto metadata fails before discovery, credential-provider access, cache access, or HTTP. Direct URI trust fails before tenant/credential/cache work. Resource Graph discovery may use management-plane credentials and HTTP first, but discovered URI trust fails before Kusto-scope token acquisition, cache insertion, or data-plane HTTP. Existing downstream identity/REST error mapping remains unchanged; new validation errors expose only the corrective property or canonical rejected hostname.
- **State lifecycle risks:** Kusto clients are cached in separate query/control-command lanes. Both lanes key on canonical origin and tenant, but cached objects do not retain request-scoped credentials or bearer tokens. Cloud configuration is immutable for the singleton process lifetime; no runtime configuration reload is introduced.
- **API surface parity:** Query, sample, schema, table, and database operations using the shared Kusto client must inherit the same custom-cloud policy. No command should implement an independent suffix or scope branch.
- **Transport security:** The original canonical hostname remains the URI authority, HTTP host, and TLS SNI. Certificate validation remains enabled; code does not rewrite requests to resolved IP literals. Kusto data-plane redirects are not followed.
- **Integration coverage:** Unit tests separately observe management-plane discovery, Kusto-scope token requests, cache insertion, and data-plane HTTP. Recorded tests prove configuration, Resource Graph discovery, credentials, and Kusto REST integration.
- **Unchanged invariants:** Existing command names/options, KQL safety validation, response models, REST paths, built-in-cloud host/scope semantics, remote HTTP/OBO behavior, and source-generated serialization remain unchanged. The narrow Kusto no-redirect policy is an intentional transport hardening.

## Risks & Dependencies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| A permissive suffix becomes an SSRF bypass | Enforce canonical DNS-suffix grammar, label-boundary matching, a required cluster label, HTTPS-only canonical origins, and rejection before token acquisition. |
| A custom token is sent to a built-in or attacker-controlled host | In custom mode, replace built-in trust and select the custom scope only after a successful custom-suffix match. |
| The suffix and scope authorize an unintended credential-delivery relationship | Treat them as one administrator trust grant, pass the sole scope unchanged, perform no inference/fallback, and document that semantic correspondence is an operator responsibility. |
| Existing custom-cloud data-plane behavior changes | The user-selected replacement policy intentionally removes implicit built-in-host trust under `CustomCloud`; classify and document this migration, provide an actionable invocation error, and keep Resource Graph-only inventory available. |
| Empty values are mistaken for optional non-adoption | Only both omitted or explicit `null` values mean non-adoption; empty/whitespace values are malformed configuration. |
| Partial configuration fails late with an opaque identity error | Validate one-property-only and malformed combinations during configuration loading with actionable property names. |
| Resource Graph returns malformed or unexpected `properties.uri` | Require equivalent fail-closed outcomes: deserialization failures stop after discovery, while parseable values pass canonical origin and suffix validation before Kusto token/cache/data-plane work. |
| Recorded tests do not prove the requested OAuth scope | Capture exact scope in deterministic client tests; use recordings only for cross-layer and protocol confidence. |
| Public-endpoints-as-custom test accidentally uses the built-in branch | Assert active `CloudType` is `CustomCloud` and make built-in suffixes unavailable except through the configured custom suffix. |
| URI variants split trust, dispatch, and cache identity | Produce one canonical HTTPS origin before cache access and use it for matching, request construction, and cache keys. |
| Redirects bypass initial endpoint validation | Use a Kusto no-redirect transport and treat every 3xx response as terminal; verify no second request for all redirect status classes. |
| Cached clients reuse one OBO user's identity for another | Keep request-scoped credentials/tokens out of cached state and verify two-user same-tenant isolation. |
| DNS or Private Link resolves a trusted host to an unexpected address | Preserve hostname-based TLS validation and document that this feature does not verify DNS ownership, restrict resolved IPs, or prevent DNS rebinding; require controlled DNS, Private DNS linkage, trusted PKI, and network egress policy operationally. |
| Kusto-only redirect configuration changes unrelated clients | Implement an additive named client, test both named and default registrations, and prohibit changes to shared default redirect semantics. |
| China/Government endpoint documentation changes | Preserve current tested mappings in this feature and continue consuming complete cluster URIs rather than constructing hosts. |

## Documentation / Operational Notes

- Operators must supply the Kusto service audience expected by their custom cloud as a complete `/.default` scope.
- The suffix authorizes every descendant hostname and must identify a Kusto-dedicated namespace, not a public suffix, registrable parent, or broad organization-wide application domain. Wildcard and arbitrary per-request trust are intentionally unsupported.
- Private Link deployments should configure the normal cluster hostname suffix and ensure deployment DNS resolves it appropriately.
- Custom DNS integrity, Private DNS linkage, valid hostname certificates, and outbound network policy are deployment prerequisites; the feature does not prove suffix ownership or constrain resolved IP ranges.
- The public-endpoints-as-custom recorded test validates code paths, not the semantics of an arbitrary sovereign cloud. Real custom-cloud deployments remain responsible for supplying their authority, ARM, Resource Graph, Kusto suffix, and Kusto scope values.
- Operators must confirm that their environment satisfies the initial one-suffix/one-audience topology before enabling the feature. Multiple namespaces, exact gateways, or endpoint-specific audiences require a future additive endpoint-grant model.
- The replacement policy is a behavioral migration for any custom-cloud deployment that previously reached a built-in Kusto hostname through the static allowlist; release notes must call this out even though the JSON file remains loadable.
- Validation should include the focused Core and Kusto projects, recorded Kusto tests, repository spelling checks, and the required local build verification for C# project changes.
